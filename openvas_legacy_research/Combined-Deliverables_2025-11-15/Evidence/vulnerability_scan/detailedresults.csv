The scanner cannot reach any of the previously open ports of the remote
host at the end of its scan.

This might be an availability problem related which might be
due to the following reasons :

- The remote host is now down, either because a user turned it
off during the scan

- A network outage has been experienced during the scan, and the remote
network cannot be reached from the scanner server any more

- The scanner has been blacklisted by the system administrator
or by automatic intrusion detection/prevention systems which have detected the
vulnerability assessment.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to
be done again

  running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be
  world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this
  vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it
  was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over
  the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group
  arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a
  'FoomaticRIPCommandLine' argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be
  achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution.","Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.

  D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU resources and network bandwidth. The attack may

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that

  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE

  be more disruptive in cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
  key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate
  with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE.

  - CVE-2022-40735: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that
  arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and
  Wiener paper found that '(appropriately) short exponents' can be used when there are adequate
  subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
  long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
  about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The
  specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability
  depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general,
  there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE
  modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this
  vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.

  - CVE-2024-41996: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
  Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to
  trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client
  may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate
