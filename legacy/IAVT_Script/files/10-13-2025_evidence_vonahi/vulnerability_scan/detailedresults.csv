The scanner cannot reach any of the previously open ports of the remote
host at the end of its scan.

This might be an availability problem related which might be
due to the following reasons :

- The remote host is now down, either because a user turned it
off during the scan

- A network outage has been experienced during the scan, and the remote
network cannot be reached from the scanner server any more

- The scanner has been blacklisted by the system administrator
or by automatic intrusion detection/prevention systems which have detected the
vulnerability assessment.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may need to
be done again
