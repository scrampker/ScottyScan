# ScottyScan

An open-source vulnerability scanning solution for IT environments. ScottyScan detects outdated software, misconfigurations, and compliance issues across your infrastructure — similar in spirit to OpenVAS.

## Features (Planned)

- **Vulnerability Scanning** — Identify known vulnerabilities across networked systems
- **Software Version Auditing** — Detect outdated or end-of-life software
- **Configuration Assessment** — Flag misconfigurations that weaken security posture
- **Compliance Checking** — Surface issues that could cause compliance failures (e.g., CIS benchmarks, NIST, PCI-DSS)

## Status

Early development. See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scrampker/ScottyScan/issues) for planned work and progress.
